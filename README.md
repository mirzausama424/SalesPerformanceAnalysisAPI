# Sales Analysis Backend

## Overview

This project provides an API to analyze sales performance data. The API is designed to help businesses track and evaluate sales metrics, allowing for data-driven decision-making. It provides endpoints for fetching, updating, and analyzing sales data.


### Key Features:
- Sales data analysis
- Sales report generation
- Real-time sales performance insights
- Secure and scalable backend

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight relational database for storing sales data.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- **SQLAlchemy**: SQL toolkit and ORM for Python, used to interact with the database.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for automating tests and deployment.

## Architecture

The backend is built using **FastAPI**, which provides a fast and efficient framework for developing RESTful APIs. The application follows a simple architecture:

1. **API Layer**: Exposes various endpoints to interact with the sales data.
2. **Service Layer**: Contains the logic for analyzing and manipulating the data.
3. **Database Layer**: Uses **SQLAlchemy** to interact with an **SQLite** database for storing and retrieving sales data.

The architecture is designed to be scalable and modular, allowing for easy extension of features, such as adding additional data analytics or integrating with third-party systems.
